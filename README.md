===========

Convert TI SmartRF Bluetooth Low Energy Packet Captures to Libpcap Format (for Python 3)

HEAD

Read a Bluetooth Low Energy packet capture savefile generated by
the TI Packet Sniffer utility (.psd file, but not PhotoShop), and convert it
to a libpcap packet capture file.  The libpcap packet capture file is formatted
to use the PPI DLT, with DLT_USER set so the BTLE Wireshark plugin can be used
to decode the BTLE traffic.

You can download the SmartRF Packet Sniffer software here:

The CC2540 USB Evaluation Kit USB dongle that captures Bluetooth LE
traffic (and injects) with default firmware is available from digikey.com
and many other sites for $50 with the part number CC2540EMK-USB.
